State Oriented Sharing is a sharing paradigm in which content in the form of
widgets is shared in relation with defined state of objects and things - that
may include both: virtual, physical or even physiological objects and states.
For example a widget can be shared with peers-group as related with
specific URL. In this case the website is the "object" and the "url"
represent a state of the object. The same principle can be applied to the
physical world too, for example a widget can be shared as related with product
using the barcode as the state. A widget can be shared using location
properties as a state.
Content Glass platform provide multiple APIs for creating State Oriented
Sharing apps. In this case we are using the Web API to let you run your own CG
apps on your website or sharing-tools we provide for various
environments and cases.
